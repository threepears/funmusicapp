# funmusicapp

An online music artist search application.

### Goal

A self-directed project building an online music search application to learn about Grunt, Sass, and APIs. Project was abandoned after successful API implementation from LastFM; more formatting and presentation changes yet to be completed. (Wanted to use AllMusic's API, but couldn't gain access so changed APIs during creation.)

### Tools Used

Grunt, Sass, Code editor.

### Installation

Create new repository and enter the following command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/threepears/funmusicapp.git
```

Now start your http server with this Terminal command:

```sh
$ http-server
```

Now open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ to start and use the application to search for information on your favorite musical artists!
